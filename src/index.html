                Welcome to OCDLA's Job Board. Job postings are removed 
                three days after the Closing Date. Postings that are marked
                as "Open Until Filled" are removed six weeks after the 
                Posting Date.
            </p>

            <p>
                You may also email your posting description to cpainter@ocdla.org 
                and we will post the job. Include the job, title, salary, location,
                and closing date.
